# WeatherAPI
Simple Weather API

Instructions on how to use:

1.) The default location that the website gets is currently fixed on Manila, Philippines.
2.) In order to change that, search for a city you want on the search bar and either press down "Enter" key or the search icon beside and it will show the city along with its weather details.

Note:
- The spelling of the city must be correct.
- If an existing city doesn't work on the search bar, and it shows "City not found.", it's probably on the API side considering I'm using a free version of openweatherAPI.

Do let me know if there's any other issues to fix :)
